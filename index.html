                    “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                 The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
                  myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
                   attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

                <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-testimonial">“Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                     I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                     I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                      The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for 
                      assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in
                       a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
                        of my developent experience.
                     It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
